This is an unofficial Docker container of the [ProtonMail Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/). Some of the scripts are based on [Hendrik Meyer's work](https://gitlab.com/T4cC0re/protonmail-bridge-docker).

## Initialization

To initialize and add account to the bridge, run the following command.

```
docker compose build
docker compose run -it protonmail-bridge init
```

If you want to use Docker Compose instead, you can create a copy of the provided example [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file, modify it to suit your needs, and then run the following command:

```
docker compose run protonmail-bridge init
```

Wait for the bridge to startup, then you will see a prompt appear for [Proton Mail Bridge interactive shell](https://proton.me/support/bridge-cli-guide). Use the `login` command and follow the instructions to add your account into the bridge. Then use `info` to see the configuration information (username and password). After that, use `exit` to exit the bridge. You may need `CTRL+C` to exit the docker entirely.

## Run

To run the container, use the following command.

```
docker compose run --service-ports
```

Or, if using Docker Compose, use the following command.

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Kubernetes

If you want to run this image in a Kubernetes environment. You can use the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart (https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/stable/protonmail-bridge) created by [@Eagleman7](https://github.com/Eagleman7). More details can be found in [#23](https://github.com/shenxn/protonmail-bridge-docker/issues/23).

If you don't want to use Helm, you can also reference to the guide ([#6](https://github.com/shenxn/protonmail-bridge-docker/issues/6)) written by [@ghudgins](https://github.com/ghudgins).

## Bridge CLI Guide

The initialization step exposes the bridge CLI so you can do things like switch between combined and split mode, change proxy, etc. The [official guide](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/bridge-cli-guide/) gives more information on to use the CLI.

## Build

For anyone who want to build this container on your own (for development or security concerns), here is the guide to do so. First, you need to `cd` into the directory (`deb` or `build`, depending on which type of image you want). Then just run the docker build command
```
docker build .
```

That's it. The `Dockerfile` and bash scripts handle all the downloading, building, and packing. You can also add tags, push to your favorite docker registry, or use `buildx` to build multi architecture images.
